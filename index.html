     <p> 
       The term renewable energy  is generally  applied to those energy resources and technologies which come from natural resources and are continually replenished on a human timescale. Renewables include wind, solar, tidal power or biomass.The share of renewable energy in the EU has increased up to 13% in 2012 and is expected to reach or go slightly above the 20% target fixed by the EU for 2020. Recently the European Commission has also proposed a new target for renewable energy of at least 27% by 2030.  The increase in renewable energy will enable the EU to cut greenhouse emissions and make it less dependent on imported energy. Stadards in the field of the development of renewable energy sources can help the uptake of new technologies in the market by enhancing confidence in the products and services offered. They can also support interoperability and common understanding and enhance resource efficiency and disseminate best practices.</p>
